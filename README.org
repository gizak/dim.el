** About

This Emacs package can be used to change the names of major and minor
modes that are displayed in the mode-line.  This is an alternative to
[[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/delight.el][delight]] package (see [[https://github.com/alezost/dim.el/#why][Why?]] section below).

** Installation

*** Manual

For the manual installation, clone the repo and add the directory to
=load-path=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/dim-dir")
(when (require 'dim nil t)
  (dim-major-names ...)
  (dim-minor-names ...))
#+END_SRC

** Usage

There are 4 functions, that you can use in your =.emacs=:

- dim-major-name
- dim-major-names
- dim-minor-name
- dim-minor-names

So you can change the names by one, like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(dim-major-name 'scheme-mode "Î»")
(dim-major-name 'help-mode "ðŸ„·")
(dim-minor-name 'isearch-mode " ðŸ”Ž")
(dim-minor-name 'view-mode " ðŸ‘€" 'view)
#+END_SRC

Or you can set multiple names at once, like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(dim-major-names
 '((emacs-lisp-mode           "EL")
   (emacs-lisp-byte-code-mode "EL-byte")
   (calendar-mode             "ðŸ“†")))
(dim-minor-names
 '((visual-line-mode   " â†©")
   (auto-fill-function " â†µ")
   (eldoc-mode         ""    eldoc)
   (whitespace-mode    " _"  whitespace)
   (paredit-mode       " ()" paredit)))
#+END_SRC

I prefer the latter variant as I like to keep all names in one place.

As you can see, the functions for major modes take a mode symbol (which
can be found by =M-: major-mode=) and a new mode-line name.

The functions for minor modes also take a mode symbol (from
=minor-mode-alist= variable) and a new name, and optionally a feature or
file name where the minor mode comes from.  It is passed to
=eval-after-load= function.  If the feature or file name is not
specified, the mode name is changed immediately, but of course only if
the mode is already available, so the package feature shouldn't be
specified only for the modes that are available right away on emacs
start (like =isearch-mode= or =visual-line-mode=).

** Why?

So why this package, if we already have [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiminishedModes][diminish]] and [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DelightedModes][delight]]?  Well,
=diminish= is great, but it is only for minor modes.

As for the =delight=, the main reason is: I don't like that it mixes
minor and major modes (they are set by =delight= function and stored in
=delighted-modes= variable).  They are essentially different things and
should be treated independently.  Also =delight= is "developed" on the
wiki, which is not convenient for using and contributing.  And finally,
I don't like some parts of the code (like adding =delight-major-mode= to
=after-change-major-mode-hook= inside =delight= function â€” it should be
a top-form!).

But I say many thanks to the author of =delight= package as the code of
=dim= is heavily based on it.
